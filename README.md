Makeup application is an e-commerce application that takes its data from the Maybelline catalog. Data from http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=maybelline api is listed and appears on the homepage.

Login-Register transactions are made with Firebase Authentication. You can login via Email/Password, Google or anonymously.

Since Firebase is on a 30-day trial, you must add your app to Firebase. Then you can use Authentication and Database operations. The products you add are created in the database section and you can see your products in the My Cart section.
